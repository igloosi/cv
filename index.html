<h3 id="front-end-developer-at-tui-group-august">Front End Developer at TUI Group August</h3>

<p>2014  -  March 2016</p>

<p>Part of the small frontend development team that looked after Crystal Ski and Thomson Lakes &amp; Mountains specialist holidays websites. We worked closely with ecommerce team to design, prototype and built new functionality to enhance user experience across multiple channels. We strived to build reusable “drop-in” components wherever the platform allowed us using modern best practices and technologies. We released our work in 3-week sprints, deployed with Jenkins  and fine-tuned our agile (scrum) process. Additionally, I built A/B tests in Qubit to test different variants.</p>

<p>For our frontend process, we wrote CSS with BEM naming convention in Sass with ScssLint, wrote javascript to JSLint standards, peer reviewed code before finally building assets with Grunt. Proportion of our time was spent on R&amp;D projects that formed future development on the platform, on improving development process, such as living styleguides, component library, Angular, or refactor legacy code.</p>

<p>We used GIT for version control, managed our projects in JIRA, wrote documentation on Confluence and communicated using Slack and HipChat. <br>

<p>Retrofitting responsive layout, but keeping the current desktop layout virtually identical. Using SASS for development, .Net C# web forms in an agile team.</p>

<p>As a sole UI/frontend developer I was tasked with retrofitting responsive layouts to the entire milkround.com website in a very short space of time. There was a need to keep the desktop layout virtually identical while maximising the user experience on tablets and phones. With a lot of the content being dynamic it was paramount that I set up the HTML and CSS correctly and flexibly. I was often required to make changes to C# code, keeping it updated with SVN. Adopting an agile approach, we used JIRA as the case tracker.</p>
